Hi there!

This website provides  Simon Wardley's book "Wardley Maps" from [medium.com](https://medium.com/wardleymaps) as an audiobook.
It uses Amazon's Polly text-to-speech cloud service to convert the texts from Simon to MP3 files.
The quality of the text synthesis is not so bad as it might sound.
Please give it a try!

If you recognize any weird pronunciations or speech errors, please feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/feststelltaste/wardley-maps-audiobook/issues).

### Origin of this website

On a Saturday, end of June 2020, I got some brand-new bone conduction headphones. Knowing that some housework was coming up, I wanted to use that time productively and listen to some good audiobooks. I also read Simon Wardley's book a while ago but wanted to go over it again just for fun. But I never found time lately. So why not LISTEN to Simons's book?

Simon published his book under an open license. So I decided to parse the Asciidoc version of the book with some Python magic and sent the content to the premium text-to-speech service "Polly" provided by Amazon. I wanted to learn how to handle Polly anyway and play around with it a little bit.

The results were not so bad. With the MP3s in hand, I thought others might find it also useful. Maybe it is in some situations more convenient to listen to the book instead of reading it. So I created this website to provide the audiobook version of "Wardley Maps" to a greater audience.
