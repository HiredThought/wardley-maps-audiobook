Hi there!

This website is an early prototype to convert Simon Wardley's book "Wardley Maps" from [medium.com](https://medium.com/wardleymaps) to an audiobook.
It uses Amazon's Polly text-to-speech cloud service to generate the texts from Simon to MP3 files.

The content is made available under the same Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike-4.0-International licence as the original posts.

The audiobook builds upon Andrew Harmel-Law work. He converted Simon Wardley's blog posts from medium.com to Asciidoc.
See his GitHub repository for more information: <https://github.com/andrewharmellaw/wardley-maps-book>

You can find the source code for this website as well as the audiofiles here <https://github.com/feststelltaste/wardley-maps-audiobook>.

The Python script voodoo is currently not online, but I'll upload it as soon as there is some time.

Best,

Markus Harrer
